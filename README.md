# Python Projects for SDE applications

I have two projects you will find; 

The solar system simulation is a fully completed simulation with multiple scenarios such as a simulation of an asteriods interaction.

My current project in progress is the Python Casino. The backend for blackjack and roulette are fully working with correct betting systems.

My future plans is to create some other games such as slots, virtual horse racing and "Crash" - a type of fast-paced online gambling game where players bet on a multiplier curve that rises over time.

From here I will look to implement front end for each game to improve UX.
