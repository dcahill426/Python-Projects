# Python Projects for SDE applications

I have two projects you will find; 

The solar system simulation is a fully completed simulation with multiple scenarios such as a simulation of an asteriods interaction.

My current project in progress is the Python Casino. The backend for blackjack is fully working and the backend for roulette is halfway complete.

My future plans is to finish roulette then begin on creating some other games such as slots, "Crash" - a type of fast-paced online gambling game where players bet on a multiplier curve that rises over time. And virtual horse racing. 

From here I will look to implement front end for each game to improve UX.
